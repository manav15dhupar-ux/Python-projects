Project name: Phone Directory 

**Problem Statement: Phone Directory Management System

Design and implement a menu-driven Python program to create and manage a Phone Directory using a dictionary.

##The program should perform the following tasks:
	1.	Display a welcome message for the phone directory.
	2.	Accept the number of initial contact entries from the user.
	3.	For each contact, input:
	•	Name
	•	Phone number
	4.	Store contact details in a dictionary, where:
	•	The name acts as the key.
	•	The phone number acts as the value.
	5.	Prevent duplicate entries by ensuring:
	•	No two contacts have the same name.
	•	No two contacts have the same phone number.
	6.	Validate phone numbers to ensure that they contain only digits.
	7.	Display a menu repeatedly with the following options:
	•	Contact List – Display all stored contact names.
	•	Find Contact – Search and display a contact’s phone number using the name.
	•	Add Contact – Add a new contact with duplicate and validity checks.
	•	Discard Contact – Remove a contact from the directory.
	•	Exit – Terminate the program.
	8.	Continue execution until the user chooses to exit.

##Constraints & Conditions
	•	Use a dictionary for storing contact information.
	•	Use loops and conditional statements to control program flow.
	•	Prevent insertion of duplicate names and phone numbers.
	•	The program should be user-friendly and menu-driven.

##Learning Outcomes
	•	Understanding of dictionary operations
	•	Menu-driven program design
	•	Input validation techniques
	•	Duplicate prevention logic
	•	Practical application of loops and flow control
