Project name:Snake–Water–Gun Game 

**Design and implement a menu-driven Python program that simulates the classic Snake–Water–Gun game between a user and the computer.

The program should:
	1.	Display a menu with the following options:
	•	Snake
	•	Water
	•	Gun
	•	Exit
	2.	Accept the user’s choice through numeric input.
	3.	Generate the computer’s choice randomly using Python’s random module.
	4.	Compare the user’s choice with the computer’s choice and determine the result based on the following rules:
	•	Snake drinks Water → Snake wins
	•	Water drowns Gun → Water wins
	•	Gun kills Snake → Gun wins
	•	Same choices result in a tie
	5.	Display both the user’s and computer’s choices in a readable format.
	6.	Use a function to handle repeated display logic for user and computer selections.
	7.	Continue the game until the user selects the Exit option.
