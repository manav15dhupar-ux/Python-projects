Project name: Employee Database Management System

**Design and implement a menu-driven Python program to manage an Employee Database using a list of dictionaries.

The program should perform the following operations:
	1.	Accept the number of employees from the user.
	2.	Store employee details such as:
	•	Employee Name
	•	Basic Salary
	•	House Rent Allowance
	•	Conveyance Allowance
	•	Total Salary (calculated automatically)
	3.	Use a dictionary to store details of a single employee and a list to store multiple employee records.
	4.	Display a menu repeatedly with the following options:
	•	Add Employee – Enter and store details of employees.
	•	View All Employees – Display all stored employee records.
	•	Search Employee – Search for an employee by name and display details.
	•	Change Employee Details – Update salary components of an employee and recalculate total salary.
	•	Exit – Terminate the program.
	5.	Ensure proper input handling and case-insensitive searching of employee names.
	6.	Continue execution until the user selects the exit option.

##Constraints & Conditions
	•	Employee records must be stored using a list of dictionaries.
	•	Searching and updating should be done by employee name.
	•	Total salary must be recalculated after any update.
	•	The program should be menu-driven and user-friendly.

##Learning Outcomes
	•	Understanding of lists and dictionaries
	•	Menu-driven program design
	•	Searching and updating data structures
	•	Logical control using loops and conditions
	•	Real-world data management concepts
