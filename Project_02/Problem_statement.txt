Project name: Indian General Store Bill Generator

**Problem Statement: Krina Store Shopping Calculator**

Develop a console-based shopping calculator for "Krina Store" (also referred to as "Manav General Store") that allows customers to input multiple purchase amounts interactively and computes the running total along with a final receipt. The program uses a loop to accept amounts until the user quits, validates numeric inputs, and displays itemized bills with grand total. [1]

## Requirements
- Display a welcome message: "======= Welcome To krina Store Calculator =======".
- Initialize total (`add=0`) and empty list (`amt_list=[]`) to track amounts.
- In a `while True` loop, prompt: "Enter the amount or press q to exit:".
- Validate input: if 'q' or 'Q', break the loop; if numeric (allowing one decimal point), add to total, append to list, and show "Total so far {add}"; else, prompt "Enter a valid amount".
- After exit, print receipt header "======MANAV GENERAL STORE======", list each amount as "Rs.{i}", and final "Total amount Rs.{add} , Thanks for coming 😁". [2]

## Sample Run
```
======= Welcome To krina Store Calculator ========

Enter the amount or press q to exit:
50.5
Total so far 50.5
Enter the amount or press q to exit:
30
Total so far 80.5
Enter the amount or press q to exit:
q

======MANAV GENERAL STORE======
Rs.50.5
Rs.30.0
Total amount Rs.80.5 , Thanks for coming 😁
```

## Key Features
- Continuous input with running total feedback.
- Simple decimal validation using `replace('.', '', 1).isdigit()`.
- Stores all valid amounts for final itemized display.
Ideal for beginner Python practice on lists, loops, input validation, and string formatting.
