Project name:Student Result Management System

**Problem Statement

Design and implement a menu-driven Python program to manage and process student academic records for a class.

The program should perform the following tasks:
	1.	Accept the number of students from the user.
	2.	For each student, input:
	•	Student name
	•	Total marks
	•	Average marks
	3.	Store student records using an appropriate data structure.
	4.	Display a menu repeatedly with the following options:
	•	Pass/Fail Status
Display whether each student has passed or failed based on their average marks.
	•	Display Student Records
Show all student details in a tabular format.
	•	Search Student Record
Allow the user to search for a student by name and display their marks and average.
	•	Merit List
Display the names of students who qualify for the merit list based on a predefined average marks criterion.
	•	Exit
Terminate the program.
	5.	Continue executing until the user chooses to exit.

⸻

##Constraints & Conditions
	•	Student records must be stored using tuples.
	•	The program should use loops and conditional statements.
	•	Searching should be performed using student names.
	•	The program should be user-friendly and menu-driven.

⸻

##Sample Evaluation Criteria (Optional for Practicals)
	•	Average ≥ 32 → Pass
	•	Average ≥ 75 → Merit List

⸻

## Learning Outcomes
	•	Understanding of tuples and lists
	•	Menu-driven programming
	•	Use of loops, conditions, and indexing
	•	Basic data handling in Python
